Here you go !**\r\n\r\nThis project is built in favour of students who work as a team on any project and intend to share links and codes with their teammates remotely(or in a local network). Mechanism which helps you to simulate the concept of shortcut copy-paste on a group of PC. Highly recommended during events like hackathon! \r\n\r\nThis would help in introducing a common clipboard among a cluster of PC.\r\n\r\n> Receive notification when other users copy any clip!\r\n\r\n## **How it works ?**\r\n\r\nCopy content from one PC using CTRL C and use CTRL V on other PC where you want to PASTE the content.\r\nJAVA implementation using JNativeHook, java sockets and clipboard. Hashset and handlers are used to manage multiple clients.\r\nNo limitations on number of users. \r\nUsers can be globally located. \r\n\r\nLibrary used : [JNativeHook](https://code.google.com/p/jnativehook/)\r\n\r\n## **How to use ?**\r\n\r\n*   Run the server CPserver in a PC, which would act as server PC. \r\n*   Run CPclient on other PC's.\r\n*   Client can be even run on server PC.\r\n*   Check whether client can ping the server, through internet or local network.\r\n*   Enter the IP of the server PC in in client program when asked to.\r\n*   Enter unique name for each client. \r\n*   Enter the list of users whom you want to share your clip. \r\n*   READY TO GO!","google":"UA-57017767-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
